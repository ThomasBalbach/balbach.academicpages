In the run-up to the 2021 German federal election, public debate focused heavily on Germany’s public administration. In this contribution, Lana Bensiek and Thomas Balbach argue that public-sector digitalization will only succeed if it produces innovation—and that requires real room for maneuver within public administrations.

Key questions:
- What do public authorities in Germany need to implement mandated digitalization in a meaningful way?
- What matters most in the context of the federal election?

Speakers:
- Lana Bensiek
- Thomas Balbach

Moderator:
- Lucas Volkmer
